Judging criteria
Our Judges will evaluate each task in five categories:
Idea & Innovation - 30%
This criterion evaluates the uniqueness and creativity of the project's concept. Judges will
look for groundbreaking ideas and inventive solutions that stand out and demonstrate a high
level of innovation.
Relation to Category - 20%
Judges assess how well the project aligns with the specific category or theme of the given
task within the hackathon. It is crucial that the project clearly fits within the defined scope,
demonstrating relevance to and fulfillment of the objectives associated with this particular
category.
Practical Applicability / Usability - 20%
This criterion evaluates the project's real-world utility and ease of use. Judges will consider
how practical and functional the solution is, with an emphasis on its ability to address
real-world needs effectively and provide a seamless user experience.
Design - 20%
The design criterion evaluates the visual appeal and aesthetics of the project. Judges will
assess the overall look and feel of the project, including the design of the user interface,
graphics, and any other visual elements.
Completeness & Implementation Value - 10%
This criterion examines the overall completeness of the project and its readiness for
implementation. Judges will consider not only the technical robustness but also whether the
project is fully developed, and if it has potential for successful implementation in real-world
scenarios.
Using Existing Resources
You are allowed to utilize existing repositories, materials, or other resources in your project,
as long as you properly cite them.
The use of AI
We recognize that Artificial Intelligence has become an inseparable part of today’s creative
and technological landscape. During HackYeah 2025, participants are welcome to use AI
tools for inspiration, research or as a means of support in the development process.
However, the core idea, concept, and final solution must remain the original work of the
team. AI should be used within the limits of common sense, ethical standards, and in full
compliance with Polish law. Whenever AI or external resources contribute to the project,
participants are obliged to provide proper credit. We trust our hackers to approach AI use
responsibly, treating it as a tool, not a substitute for creativity.
